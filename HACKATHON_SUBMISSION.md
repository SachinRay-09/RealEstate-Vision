## 🤖 How Kiro Powered This Project

### Development Approach: Conversational Architecture

**Total Development Time**: 3 hours (single session)
**Lines of Code Generated**: 5,000+
**Components Created**: 25+
**Documentation Files**: 15+

### Kiro Usage Highlights

#### 1. Role-Based Prompting ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Used role-based conversations to guide development:
```
"Role: RealEstate Vision Architect (MCP)"
"Role: Senior UI/UX Designer (Hackathon Specialist)"
"Role: Senior Frontend Engineer & UX Designer"
```

**Result**: Kiro immediately understood context and generated appropriate solutions.

#### 2. Iterative Refinement ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Rapid feedback loops for continuous improvement:
- **Iteration 1**: Basic structure → Complete architecture
- **Iteration 2**: Flat UI → Cinematic glass design
- **Iteration 3**: Invisible map → Live satellite background
- **Iteration 4**: Poor contrast → AAA compliance
- **Iteration 5**: Simple model → Detailed 3D house

#### 3. Real-Time Problem Solving ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Critical bugs fixed through conversation:
- Leaflet map height collapse (0px → 100vh)
- Tailwind CSS @apply incompatibility
- White-on-white button contrast
- Text visibility issues
- Z-index layering problems

#### 4. Comprehensive Documentation ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Generated 15+ documentation files:
